            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>This website was designed with the aim to bridge the gap between creative minds and companies across the world becuase we believe that the world is full of creative minds with innovative
                ideas, but not everyone has the resources or connections to turn their ideas into reality. So, we do it for them. This way the website offers
                a unique opportunity for the companies to tap into the creativity of people around the world. For idea proposers, this website offers a
                chance to monetize your creativity and get recognition for your ideas. Our website streamlines the process of buying and selling ideas, making it easier for both parties to benefit from each other's creativity. </p>
